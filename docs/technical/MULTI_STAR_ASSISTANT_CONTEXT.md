# AI Assistant Context: Multi-Star Pipeline - Phase 1 Validation

## Objective
The immediate goal is to validate the newly created multi-star simulation pipeline by executing the unit tests and debugging any resulting errors.

## Current State
The foundational code for Phase 1 is complete. A new package, `multi_star`, has been created and integrated with the existing `star_tracker_pipeline.py` and the `BAST` module. All necessary files have been written to disk.

### New File Manifest
- `multi_star/__init__.py`
- `multi_star/synthetic_catalog.py`
- `multi_star/scene_generator.py`
- `multi_star/multi_star_radiometry.py`
- `multi_star/multi_star_pipeline.py`
- `multi_star/validation.py`
- `tests/test_triangle_matching.py`
- `tests/test_pyramid_validation.py`
- `examples/demo_triangle_matching.py`
- `examples/demo_pyramid_validation.py`

### Key Integration Points & Logic Flow
1.  `synthetic_catalog.py` creates a `pandas.DataFrame` that is passed to the `BAST.catalog.Catalog` class. This leverages the existing, proven triplet generation logic in `BAST`.
2.  `multi_star_pipeline.py` orchestrates the entire process. It uses the new `scene_generator` and `radiometry` modules to create a multi-star image.
3.  This image is then passed to the **existing** `pipeline.detect_stars_and_calculate_centroids` and `pipeline.calculate_bearing_vectors` methods.
4.  The resulting bearing vectors are passed to the **existing** `BAST.match.match` function, along with the synthetic catalog.
5.  The `validate_matches` method in `multi_star_pipeline.py` dynamically calls the correct validation function from `validation.py` based on the number of stars in the scene.

### Important Code Modifications
- **`multi_star/multi_star_pipeline.py`**: The `validate_matches` method was updated from a placeholder to a function that correctly dispatches to `validate_triangle_matches` or `validate_pyramid_consistency`.
- **`BAST/match.py`**: The import `from catalog import ...` on line 17 was changed to `from .catalog import ...` to fix a relative import error. This is critical for the `BAST` package to function correctly.

## Immediate Task: Execute Unit Tests

The code has been written but not yet run. The next action is to execute the unit tests.

**Command 1: Test 3-Star Triangle Matching**
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_triangle_matching.py
```

**Command 2: Test 4-Star Pyramid Validation**
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_pyramid_validation.py
```

## Expected Outcome & Potential Issues

- **Expected Outcome:** The tests should run. It is possible they will fail due to bugs in the new code or unforeseen integration issues.
- **Debugging Focus:** If tests fail, the primary areas to investigate are:
    1.  **Coordinate Systems:** Ensure the `_sky_to_detector` projection in `scene_generator.py` and the PSF placement in `multi_star_radiometry.py` are handled correctly.
    2.  **Data Flow:** Trace the data structures (especially dictionaries like `scene_data`) through `multi_star_pipeline.py` to ensure keys are consistent.
    3.  **`PYTHONPATH`:** The tests rely on relative imports within `multi_star` and `BAST`. Ensure the execution environment can resolve these imports. Running with `python -m unittest` from the project root should handle this.
- **Success for this Task:** The task is complete once the unit tests pass and any discovered bugs are fixed.
