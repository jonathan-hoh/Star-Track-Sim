# Multi-Star Pipeline: Phase 1 Handoff & Status

**Date:** 2025-07-03

## 1. Overview

This document marks the completion of the initial scaffolding for the multi-star simulation pipeline. The foundational code is now in place to generate, render, and analyze scenes with multiple stars, with the primary goal of validating the existing `BAST` triangle and pyramid matching algorithms.

## 2. Current Status: **Implementation Complete**

The core components for Phase 1 have been implemented and organized into a new `multi_star` package.

### Key Accomplishments:
- **Architectural Plan:** A detailed plan for all phases is documented in `MULTI_STAR_PHASE_1_PLAN.md`.
- **`multi_star` Package:** All new functionality is encapsulated in this package.
  - `synthetic_catalog.py`: Creates controlled 3-star and 4-star test scenarios.
  - `scene_generator.py`: Translates catalog data into detector scene information.
  - `multi_star_radiometry.py`: Renders multiple PSFs onto a single detector image.
  - `multi_star_pipeline.py`: Integrates the new components with the existing `StarTrackerPipeline` and `BAST` modules.
  - `validation.py`: Provides logic to validate test results.
- **Testing Framework:** A full suite of unit tests and interactive demos has been created.
  - `tests/test_triangle_matching.py`
  - `tests/test_pyramid_validation.py`
  - `examples/demo_triangle_matching.py`
  - `examples/demo_pyramid_validation.py`
- **Code Corrections:** A relative import issue in `BAST/match.py` was fixed to ensure proper package integration.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps: **Validation**

The entire codebase for Phase 1 is written but **has not yet been executed**. The immediate next step is to run the tests to validate the implementation.

1.  **Run Unit Tests:**
    -   `python -m unittest tests/test_triangle_matching.py`
    -   `python -m unittest tests/test_pyramid_validation.py`
2.  **Debug:** Address any errors or failures that arise from the tests.
3.  **Run Demos:** Execute the interactive demo scripts to visually confirm the pipeline's behavior.

## 4. Remaining Work for Phase 1

- **Refine Validation Logic:** Enhance the validation functions in `multi_star/validation.py` if necessary.
- **Code Review & Documentation:** Perform a final pass on the new code to add docstrings and comments.
- **Final Handoff:** Conclude Phase 1 upon successful validation, confirming the system's capability to perform multi-star matching.
